# CRM Sales Dashboard for SoftTech

I recently built a dynamic Google Sheets dashboard to help track sales opportunities for SoftTech, a computer hardware company. 

This dashboard was designed to solve the issue of limited data visibility outside their platform and to provide sales managers with an easy-to-use tool to monitor quarterly performance.

üîç Key Objectives: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare data for analysis: Ensuring clean and structured data for meaningful insights. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Explore data with pivot tables: Unlocking hidden trends with pivot tables to analyze key metrics. 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Build a dynamic dashboard: Bringing it all together with actionable visuals for better decision-making.

üìä Dashboard Highlights:

Opportunities chart for Q4 2017
Win/Loss percentage breakdown in the quarter
Sales opportunities won by agents in the recent quarter
Interactive slicers for regional offices and managers

This dashboard empowers sales managers to stay on top of their game with real-time insights! üí°

Looking forward to more opportunities like this! Check out the dashboard below.
